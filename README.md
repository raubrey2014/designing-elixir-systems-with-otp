## Designing Elixir Systems with OTP


[This book](https://pragprog.com/book/jgotp/designing-elixir-systems-with-otp) by James Edward Gray, II and Bruce A. Tate was brought to my attention by [this blog post](https://dockyard.com/blog/2020/04/01/refactoring-a-function-in-elixir).

Next thing I knew, I had enhaled the example chapter, bought the book, and was making steady progress through the chapters. This repository is a collection of that progress.
